# IRC_test

to start the program, run make on the root directory, which will create 2 executables:

run ./server <port> with the port of your choosing (ex: 6667).

in a separate terminal tab/window, run ./client <port> with the same port as the server.

Enter a username, and you can send messages to the server.
You can open other terminals and add other users to the server to communicate between terminals.
